Whatever your business idea is, you need a home turf. Space is ridiculously important, and also ridiculously dependent on your personality. What’s a perfect work environment for Karen might be a place where Grant will never be able to concentrate. And that’s okay!

##Break Down The Numbers
The first thing you need to do when you’ve decided you need an office, is to break down some numbers: 

* Is it just you in the start-up? How many people does your office need to accommodate?
* Do you have a budget? If so, what is it? 
* How many square meters do you need? Are you a SaaS startup that only needs WiFi and a computer, or do you need space for buying socks and jam in bulk?
* How long are you willing to commute? Pick an area that suits the needs of you and your business

##Different Offices
Once you’ve figured out the logistics behind the grand decision - it’s time to think about your options. As a start-up, you’ve often got the following options: 

* The home office 
* Hot-desking
* Coworking
* Incubator office
* Renting a private office 

What you choose should not only depend on numbers, but on you and your personality. 

Are you a one wo/man business and do you have a good office space in your home? Why not start out working from home? If things are taking up too much space, [rent a small space](http://www.storagevault.com/business-storage-glasgow/) for storing the things you don’t need very often. 

Does networking and an office buzz motivate you? Then renting a space at [Rookieoven](https://rookieoven.com/coworking/) or [Codebase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com/about/) will be right up your alley.

If chatter disturbs your work and complete silence is your ideal work environment, then hot- desking and coworking can be lethal to your start-up. [Storage Vault](http://www.storagevault.com/) provides office spaces that are more private, allowing you to choose more freely when you want to engage in the social aspects of starting a business.

When you’ve found an office that suits you, clap your hands, don’t forget to celebrate (never forget to celebrate) - then get to work and make your brilliant business idea happen!

##Getting Down To Business
We asked our tenants at [Storage Vault Workspace](https://storagevaultworkspace.com/) for their [top tips](http://www.storagevault.com/productivity-tips/) when nailing your own time and getting down to business. Their tips blew our mind, so here you go:

* Being productive doesn’t mean working 9-5 voll gas. Breaks are healthy, if anything you should practise your break skills. Merlin Mann proposed a [(10+2)*5 methodology](http://www.43folders.com/2005/10/11/procrastination-hack-1025); work for 10 minutes, break for 2, repeat 5 times. 
* Fail to prepare, prepare to fail. Live by this saying. Break your day into job- specific timeslots: 9:00-9:20, catch up and plan today. 9:20-10:15, write new blog. 10:15-10:30, call bank.
* Separate your spaces. Does your significant other complain that you check your emails from bed? If you need a home office, assign a certain space for it so the ‘home feeling’ doesn’t disappear 
* Cut pop-ups. Push and pop-up notifications are essential for two professions. One, on-call heart surgeons. Two, Wall Street stock traders. Most of us don’t fall into either of these categories, and for the vast majority - they’re nothing but distractions.   
* Go on that run, play that game of rugby, or do that hour of yoga. Working out is proven to stimulate the release of endorphins - and sets you up for a happier life.
* Break down big jobs into mini- tasks. You’ll feel the achievement of ticking off ‘jobs done’ and you can map and track your journey towards your end goal. 

Good luck with your business idea, your new office, and bravo for reaching the end of the article!
